<h2>Solution For Hotspot Login Page with LB PCC - Mikrotik Script</h2>

Having trouble with the Hotspot Login Page in PCC Load Balancing which often fails to appear or doesn't automatically redirect?

Just add this in NAT for hotspot=auth


Still failing too? we play a little with hotspot = auth in Load balancing PCC in mangle, adjust it to each condition, for example like this, just add hotspot=auth

/ip firewall nat add action=accept chain=pre-hotspot disabled=no dst-address-type=!local hotspot=auth


Still failed too? delete all the above methods and try to bypass all local traffic, make sure it is located at the top of the mangle (LOCAL-IP respectively, enter in the add-list)

add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting dst-address-list=!IP-LAN dst-address-type=!local hotspot=auth new-connection-mark=E1-WAN_connmark passthrough=yes per-connection-classifier=both-addresses-and-ports:2/0 src-address-list=IP-LAN
add action=mark-connection chain=prerouting dst-address-list=!IP-LAN dst-address-type=!local hotspot=auth new-connection-mark=E2-WAN_connmark passthrough=yes per-connection-classifier=both-addresses-and-ports:2/1 src-address-list=IP-LAN
